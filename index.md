## Personal qualities

Purposefulness, responsibility, punctuality, attention to detail.<br>
But the most important quality in my opinion is the ability and desire to learn. It is not a problem for me to get on a project with technologies unfamiliar to me. I have excellent self-learning ability. I'm not afraid to ask questions if I can't solve them myself.<br>
I have extensive experience in developing web applications, which helps me find non-trivial solutions to various problems!
